[*Satellite Transceiver Breakout - Swarm M138*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/19236)

A breakout for the Swarm M138 satellite transceiver.

This breakout allows you to power and communicate with the Swarm M138 using USB 3 or USB-C.

You can also integrate it directly into your project; the breakout pads can be used to provide power and access the 3.3V UART TX and RX signals.

Our [Swarm Satellite Arduino Library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Swarm_Satellite_Arduino_Library) makes communicating with the modem really easy.
